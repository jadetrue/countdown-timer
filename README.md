## üß∞ My process

### Built with

-   [CRA](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) ‚ù§Ô∏è
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

-   I learned more about custom hooks, this was an interesting and cleaner way of coding in my opinion.

### Continued development

-   In this challenge, I created a custom hook to be able calculate the countdown timing function. This was particularly used for learning purposes.
-   I would love to have more experience working with SVGs to understand why I could not get my footer background to be the full width of the users screen.
-   The flipping animation would be cool too revisit (currently does not do this).
-   Fix the opacity for the actual countdown to be as similar to the design as possible.
